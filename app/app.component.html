<h3>Hello, {{ name }}</h3>

<p>
  In index.html, a Vue component is defined using Vue and is wrapped into a Web
  Component using vue-custom-element.<br />

  Now, in Angular's template, use it as if it were a native HTML Element (or
  regular native Web Component).
</p>

<input [(ngModel)]="name" />

<my-vue-web-comp [msg]="name" (msgChanged)="updateName($event.detail[0])"></my-vue-web-comp>
